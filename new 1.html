When we love someone, we often spend comforting gestures for them. Pet them on the head, hug them tightly or stare at them lovingly. We don't hide our special affection for them!

The baby monkey is no exception. He follows the ducklings and the pack also accompanies him. They walk around the grass and discover things together. The cute "gang" is inseparable!

When the little monkey starts to climb the trees, he keeps looking down at the ground to check on his ducklings. The cute yellow gang is waiting for him to come back and join them.

The odd friends even refuse to separate from one another when having snacks. The baby monkey is eating some daily nutrients while his fuzzy friends are enjoying some delicious rice.

A delicious meal doesn't always refer to what you eat and how good it is. The people who enjoy the meal with you are more important. Simply, you find happiness during the meal.

There are few things cuter than baby monkeys and ducklings, so when the two come together, it's cuteness overload!
